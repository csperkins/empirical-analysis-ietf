\title{An Empirical Analysis of the Internet Engineering Task Force 
       with Computational Methods}
\author{Colin Perkins\\University of Glasgow}

\begin{abstract}
  % Four sentences:
  %  - State the problem
  %  - Say why it's an interesting problem
  %  - Say what your solution achieves
  %  - Say what follows from your solution

  The Internet requires interoperability between networks, systems, and
  applications, as well as cooperation among a growing number of
  stakeholders. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is critical in
  supporting this cooperation and interoperability by bringing together
  interested parties and standardising the protocols that power the
  Internet, such as IPv4/6 or HTTP/s. Our work covers more 20 years of IETF
  data, and analyses the participants of the IETF, the emails they
  exchange, and the documents they produce. We show how these data can be
  used to understand who are these Internet actors, and their interests as
  well as how Internet's growth and maturity has given rise to a longer and
  complex standardisation process where participants gain and exercise
  influence and how this is reflected in the language they use and the
  interactions they have.

\section{Introduction}

% A good paper introduction is fairly formulaic. If you follow a simple set
% of rules, you can write a very good introduction. The following outline can
% be varied. For example, you can use two paragraphs instead of one, or you
% can place more emphasis on one aspect of the intro than another. But in all
% cases, all of the points below need to be covered in an introduction, and
% in most papers, you don't need to cover anything more in an introduction.
%
% Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you
% are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger
% context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger
% community?



% Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This
% paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first
% paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you
% establish specific context and background.



% Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that...". This is the key paragraph
% in the introduction - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main
% contributions of your paper, given the context established in paragraphs
% 1 and 2. What's the general approach taken? Why are the specific results
% significant? The story is not what you did, but rather:
%  - what you show, new ideas, new insights
%  - why interesting, important?
% State your contributions: these drive the entire paper.  Contributions
% should be refutable claims, not vague generic statements.

In this paper, we ...

% Paragraph 4: What are the differences between your work, and what others
% have done? Keep this at a high level, as you can refer to future sections
% where specific details and differences will be given, but it is important
% for the reader to know what is new about this work compared to other work
% in the area.



% Paragraph 5: "We structure the remainder of this paper as follows." Give
% the reader a road-map for the rest of the paper. Try to avoid redundant
% phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ..., In Section 4, ... ", etc.

We structure the remainder of this paper as follows.

\section{Related Work}

% This should come near the end, and focussing on discussing how your work
% relates to that of others. Any relevant related work should have been
% cited already, so this is not a list of related work, it's a discussion
% of how that work relates.
%
% Why not put related work after the introduction? 1) because describing
% alternative approaches gets between the reader and your idea; and 2)
% because the reader knows nothing about the problem yet, so your
% (carefully trimmed) description of various technical trade-offs is
% absolutely incomprehensible.
%
% When writing the related work:
%  - Give credit to others where it's due; this doesn't diminish the
%    credit you get from your paper.
%  - Acknowledge weaknesses in your approach.
%  - Ensure related work is accurate and up-to-date
